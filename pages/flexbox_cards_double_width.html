                <h3>Beauty Of Forest</h3>
                <p>For in the true nature of things, if we rightly consider, every green tree is far more glorious than
                    if
                    it were made of gold and silver.</p>

                <p>Advice from the ocean: Be shore of yourself. Come out of your shell. Take time to coast. Avoid pier
                    pressure. Sea life’s beauty. Don’t get so tide down on work that you miss out on life’s beautiful
                    waves.

                <h3>Indian Culture</h3>
                <p>Indian culture certainly gives the Indian mind, including the mind of the Indian scientist, the
                    ability
                    to think out of the box.</p>

                <h3>Secrets Of Universe</h3>
                <p>For as vast as the universe is, so are the secrets therein! And one can lose, because of that thought
                    that in the secrets, everything is to be gained! But I can see, that all the knowledge of hidden
                    things,
                    all the knowledge in the universe, is not nearly as valuable and as worthy as the innocence of one's
